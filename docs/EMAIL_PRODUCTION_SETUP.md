# Email Setup for Production

## Current Status
- ✅ Contact form is working and saving submissions
- ✅ Form validation and user feedback implemented
- ❌ Email sending requires production server setup

## Development vs Production

### Development (Current - Replit)
- Form submissions are saved to `submissions/` folder
- Toast notifications work perfectly
- No actual emails sent (sendmail not configured)

### Production Setup (Hostinger/Live Server)

#### Option 1: Native PHP Mail (Recommended)
```php
// In production, replace contact-handler-dev.php with:
$admin_email = 'your-actual-email@yourdomain.com';
$from_email = 'noreply@yourdomain.com';

// PHP mail() will work automatically on most hosting providers
$mail_sent = mail($admin_email, $email_subject, $email_content, $headers);
```

#### Option 2: SMTP Configuration
If native mail() doesn't work, configure SMTP:

```php
// Add these settings to your PHP configuration
ini_set('SMTP', 'mail.yourdomain.com');
ini_set('smtp_port', 587);
ini_set('sendmail_from', 'noreply@yourdomain.com');
```

#### Option 3: Use PHPMailer (Already Available)
The existing `contact-handler.php` uses PHPMailer with SMTP authentication.

## Quick Production Deployment

1. **Upload files to your hosting provider**
2. **Update email addresses** in the contact handler:
   - Change `contact@acadifysolution.com` to your real email
   - Change `noreply@acadifysolution.com` to your domain
3. **Test the form** - emails should work automatically
4. **Check submissions folder** as backup for any failed emails

## File Structure
```
/
├── contact-handler-dev.php    (Development - saves to file)
├── contact-handler-simple.php (Simple email version)
├── contact-handler.php        (Advanced PHPMailer version)
├── submissions/               (Development form submissions)
└── pages/contact.html         (Contact form page)
```

## Email Templates
Both admin notification and user confirmation emails are included with professional HTML styling.

## Troubleshooting
- If emails don't send in production, check hosting provider's mail logs
- Ensure your domain has proper DNS/MX records
- Some hosts require SMTP authentication
- Check spam folders for test emails
