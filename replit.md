## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The website is a Multi-Page Application (MPA) built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, optimized for SEO and navigation. It utilizes a component-based structure with reusable elements like the navbar and footer, dynamically loaded. A mobile-first responsive design approach is implemented with breakpoints at 768px (mobile), 1024px (tablet), and desktop.

### Design System
The visual design is based on a pure black background theme (#000000) accented with electric blue (#00BFFF), neon green (#39FF14), and orange (#FFA500). Typography uses the Poppins font family. A consistent component system dictates spacing, shadows, borders, and animation patterns.

### JavaScript Architecture
JavaScript is organized modularly with separate files for components and main functionality. It follows a class-based ES6 organization for logic and component management. Performance is optimized using Intersection Observers, throttled events, and optimized animations within an event-driven architecture.

### Navigation System
The navigation features a mega menu for Services and Industries, providing organized dropdown panels. It supports multi-page navigation with dynamic component loading. A mobile-responsive hamburger menu with smooth animations is included, along with active states for dynamic page highlighting.

### Page Structure
The website includes key pages such as Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Blog, Contact, Schedule Meeting, Careers, Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, and Sitemap. It also features dedicated sub-pages for 18 specific services (e.g., Web Development, Mobile App Development, UI/UX Design, Cloud Services, AI Solutions, Digital Marketing, Data Analytics, SEO, SMM, Email Marketing, Google Ads, WhatsApp Marketing, QA & Testing, Technology Consulting, Maintenance & Support, Logo Design, Brand Strategy, Custom Software) and 14 industry-specific pages (e.g., Healthcare, Education, Finance, Retail, Wellness & Beauty, E-commerce, Real Estate, FinTech, Travel, IT, NGOs, Media, Logistics). Additionally, there are 6 product pages (Acadify ERP, CRM, Inventory, POS, LMS, Task).

### Performance Considerations
Performance is addressed through dynamic HTML component injection (navbar/footer), modular CSS with design system variables, optimized Poppins web font loading with display swap, and hardware-accelerated transforms and Intersection Observer for animations.
